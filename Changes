1.22 2003-04-16
  - Added the much-desired weekstartsonmonday() method. Now weeks can start on Monday and end with the weekend, instead of the American style of starting on Sunday.

1.21 2003-04-06
  - Fixed the internals of setcontent() et al (see the method's doc for details).
  - Made getdatehref(), setdatehref(), and datecolor() et al, able to handle weekdays in addition to numeric dates.

1.20 2003-04-04
  - was a mistake on my part and was immediately superseded by 1.21.

1.19 2003-01-14
  - Fixed as_HTML() such that blank/0 values can be used for various values, e.g. border size, colors, etc. Previously, values had to be non-zero or they were assumed to be undefined.

1.18 2002-07-07
  - Added methods: tableclass(), sunday(), saturday(), weekdays(). Now day names can be internationalized!

1.17 2002-05-17
  - Corrected B<-w> warnings about uninitialized values in as_HTML().

1.16 2002-05-06
  - Fixed a very stupid bug that made addcontent() and setcontent() not work. Sorry!

1.15 2002-05-04
  - Added the datecolor(), datecontentcolor(), datebordercolor(), and datecellclass() methods, allowind cosmetic attributes to be changed on a per-date basis.

1.14 2002-05-04
  - Added the contentfontsize() method.

1.13 2001-11-11
  Added more CSS methods: headerclass(), weekdaycellclass(), weekndcellclass(), todaycellclass(). Added a test to the module distribution at the urging of CPAN testers.

1.12 2001-11-05
  - Fixed lots of warnings that were generated if B<-w> was used, due to many values defaulting to undef/blank.
  - Added the sharpborders(), nowrap(), cellheight(), cellclass(), and weekdayheadersbig() methods.
  - cellclass(), the beginning of CSS support. Thanks, Bray!

1.11 2001-08-18
  - The module's VERSION is now properly specified, so "use" statements won't barf if they specify a minimum version.
  - Added the vcellalignment() method so vertical content alignment is independent of horizontal alignment.

1.10 2001-07-01
  - Estimated date as this version was not released to CPAN
  - Added the headercontentcolor(), weekendheadercontentcolor(), and weekdayheadercontentcolor() methods, and made content headers use bgcolors, etc properly.

1.09 2001-06-18
  - Fixed the "2Monday", et al support; a bug was found by Dale Wellman <dwellman@bpnetworks.com> where the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days weren't properly computing which Nth weekday they were so "1Monday" wouldn't work if the first Monday was the 7th of the month.

1.08 2001-06-02
  - Re-did the bugfixes described in 1.05, handling padded and non-integer dates.

1.07 2001-05-26
  - Fixed a typo that caused an entirely empty calendar to be displayed very small.

1.06 2001-05-26
  - Changed the "which weekday" interface a bit; truncations such as "2Tue" no longer work, and must be spelled out entirely ("2Tuesday"). Added "plural weekdays" support (e.g. "wednesdays" for "every wednesday").

1.05 2001-05-22
  - addcontent(), et al can now take strings such as '06' or decimals such as '3.14' and will handle them correctly.

1.04 2001-05-21
  - Added the "which weekday" capability to addcontent(), setcontent(), and getcontent()

1.03 2001-04-25
  - More color methods!

  - Added the color methods.

1.01 2001-03-10
  - Added VALIGN to cells, to make alignment work with browsers better.
